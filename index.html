      <h1>What is Maids</h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>
        The concept of a Medical AI Data Sheet (MAIDS) is inspired by the work of Gebru et al., 19 Mar 2020 [arXiv:1803.0901v7], which collects the thoughts and ideas across the data community on how best to communicate datasets to maximise their value and inspire future work and collaboration. MAIDS is intended to encourage open and transparent communication of data assets while maintaining high standards of data security if required by regulation, ethical or other legal concerns.</p>
        
        <p>
A dataset's value is increased by thoughtful description of the motivation behind creating the dataset in the first place, the composition of the dataset and how it was collected, whether any preprocessing / cleaning / labeling was done, intended uses of the data, and how the dataset is intended to be distributed and maintained. Transparency on these components neither harms the impact data owners might otherwise achieve by hiding such information nor does it harm anyone described by the underlying data itself. Thus, any such descriptions may be freely shared with interested data consumers (a.k.a. the public) and by this dissemination, safely increase the scientific value of the dataset. <br>
On the other hand, a dataset's value is decreased when avoiding proper description of these topics as it can lead to bias and discrimination (intended or not), improper use/research, technical misunderstanding, forgotten provenance, unsafe exposure, etc.
